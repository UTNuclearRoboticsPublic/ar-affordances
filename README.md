# Defining Robot Manipulations with Augmented Reality Demonstrations

# About
This is an end-to-end system that enables users to perform a single manipulation tasks demonstration, via an augmented reality headset, and command a mobile manipulator to perform a manipulation on the object. The system is robust and generalizable and is intended for human-robot teams working in unknown and unstructured environments. To learn more watch the demonstration video hyperlinked below or read the submitted 2023 IEEE IROS conference paper linked below.
